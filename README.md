-Hi me,

What im planning to do here is basically make a modular CLI application Based on Python3 - taking advantage of the millions of python-based modules and APIs.
The main purpose of the project is to make kind of my childhood's programmer dream true; to connect multiple applications in only one and making my life easier
by basically giving myself the power to control a part of my digital and real life with this cli project.

My first thought is to make a main file which is going to be the plain cli as well written and commented as posible and by that adding then other files that basically
will connect to other apps such as ( Notion coming to my mind or discord even this server thing i've been doing).

Im planning this to be my MAIN big project which is going to be improving as the time passes, and yeah (Today is 5/5/2022 at 11:20pm)
